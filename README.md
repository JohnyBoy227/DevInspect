DevInspect

What is DevInspect? 

As First Year Computer Science students we recognise how much internships take time and energy from companies and senior developers who track our progress. As we are thankful for the energy that they they put into us, we have created a proof of concept project for our idea: DevInspect, powered by the portia AI agent. 

How does it work? 

DevInspect fetches an intern's or junior developer's changes from GitHub and then uses the Claude LLM to review the code for errors. Our program prompts Claude to look for good programming practices, such as, but not limited to: 
        • structure and organiation
        • error handling
        • proper documentation. 

Though, through our testing we have seen that sometimes minor points of critism are picked out by the agent. As a result, some of the feedback generated by the AI may be overly critcal. While this feedback could all go to the intern/junior developer, in order to produce constructive, encouraging, and actionable feedback that supports their growth, we have the senior developer review and refine the suggestions before they're delivered. This is where the Portia.AI agent is key to our program. 

From here Portia.AI comes through with some ideas for feedback. The senior developer then accepts or rejects Portia AI's agent's feedback based on its validity. 

Once the Senior Developer has gone through all the feedback reviews the final collection of the reviews is collated, ready for the junior developer to see and appropriately conitnue to grow on their project.

In this first image we can see the DevInspect UI. Simple and functional. For the purposes of testing we manually input our changes, rather than fetching from GitHub.

In this second image the junior developer's changes have been inserted by the senior devloper.

The senior developer will opt to select 'Review Changes' and then will view Portia's comments on the junior developer's work.

The senior developer has decided to 'Accept Feedback' and is shown, in a seperate text box, the collated feedback, across all accepted lines.

The senior developer has decided to 'Reject Feedback' and the line is no longer visible to the senior developer.

Once all feedback has been reviewed, the senior developer receives a clear and concise summary, displayed in a dedicated section; outlining areas for improvement and celebrating the junior developer’s strengths.
